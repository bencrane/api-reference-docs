# Growth & GTM Solutions - Build Targeted Lead Lists

> Source: https://documentation.enigma.com/growth/lead-lists

When you want to target a specific segment of businesses, filtering with high-level, one-size-fits-all categories like NAICS can be cumbersome. Often, the set of businesses you're interested in doesn't fit neatly into any existing category. That's why Enigma enables you to define your own segments on the fly with its business description filter.

The business description filters based on the meaning of words rather than the words themselves. To learn more about the differences between semantic filtering and keyword searching, see our guide.

## Walkthrough: Building a Lead List

Say you've just been hired as a Latex Salesman at Vandelay Industries, an importer and wholesaler of latex. You need to build a list of leads — businesses that buy latex. Latex is used to make all kinds of things — gloves, balloons, even mattresses. These businesses don't fit neatly into a single NAICS category, or any other categorization scheme. With Enigma, we'll define a segment of promising leads for your fine latex goods in just a few minutes.

### Step 1: Describe the Business

Navigate to the [Enigma Console Segments page](https://console.enigma.com/). At the top, you'll see the "Describe the Business" filter. Just type in what you're looking for the same way that you might describe it to someone else:

> `companies that sell products made with latex`

You'll see that the filter has returned over 500 brands, with over 500 associated operating locations, and nearly 200 associated legal entities. These are the primary entities in [Enigma's data model](/getting_started/data_model). The preview table is a list of the first 25 brands that satisfy the criteria you've filtered for.

Brands operating in dozens of different industries are included in the results. The results include several businesses with names that might match a keyword search, like "LA BALLOONS" or "PHOENIX LATEX", but also several businesses that would not:

- **Diversitex** — a manufacturer of industrial fabrics
- **High Tech Elastomers** — a manufacturer of specialty parts for the aerospace industry
- **Sherwon Industries Inc** — a manufacturer of thermoplastics and rubbers

Because Enigma's business data set is constantly evolving, your results may differ somewhat from these results, but they'll be similar.

### Step 2: Apply Additional Filters

You only have so much time for outreach, so you should further filter this list to the most promising leads. Your company is based in New York, and you know that a business needs to make at least one hundred thousand dollars a year in revenue to purchase latex in high volumes.

**Geography filter:**

- Select the "Geography" button then enter `New York` in the "States" field.
- Optionally, you can enter more than one state or filter for Cities, Zip Codes, and MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) as well.

**Revenue filter:**

- Select the "Business Characteristics" button, then enter `100,000` in the "Min" field of the "Annual Revenue (12m)" filter.
- Select the "Apply Filters" button in the top right corner to apply these filters along with your existing Business Description filter.

That narrows the list down considerably.

### Additional Filter Options

You can filter brands on many additional attributes, such as:

- **Industry attributes** — such as NAICS Code and Enigma Industry Descriptions
- **Person attributes** — such as whether there are any contacts with phone numbers or email addresses associated with the business
- **Status attributes** — such as the total number of reviews, total count of operating locations, or operating status of those locations
- **Additional business characteristics** — such as annual growth rate percentage

You can clear filters you've previously applied at any time by selecting the "Clear All" button in the top right corner.
