# TheirStack - General - Quickstart

Learn how to build a job or company search in the app, then copy the exact cURL to run the same query with the Job Search API in minutes.

The easiest way to get started with our API is to build a search in our app. You can explore filters, preview results, and copy the exact cURL you'll need to run the same search via the API.

1. Create a new job or company search.
2. Use our 30+ filters to narrow down your search and preview the result.
3. In the top-right corner of the results, click API. This opens a modal where you can copy the cURL needed to replicate the same search with the API.

From this modal, you can:

- Copy the cURL to your clipboard and paste it into your terminal (or an HTTP client like Postman).
- Copy a Make.com HTTP module and paste it directly into a scenario (see the Make.com integration documentation).
- Copy an n8n module and paste it into an n8n workflow.
